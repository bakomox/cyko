cyko is a batch video encoder for mini size anime encoding/transcoding powered by HandBrake
inspired by BENCOS, Real Anime 6 and Minicoder this program encodes/transcodes Fansub anime to small sizes

latest releases -> https://github.com/ckmox/cyko/releases

download the latest HandBrakeCLI (select the one with the words Win and CLI) from here -> https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake-snapshots 

extract the .zip archive on thesame location as cyko for example cyko is located at "c:\cyko\"
then put HandBrakeCLI inside "c:\cyko\" and then inside "c:\cyko\" you will see cyko.exe and HandBrakeCLI.exe 
then thats it run cyko and use it

updating HandBrakeCLI is thesame thing only difference is you have to overwrite the HandbrakeCLI.exe
with the updated HandbrakeCLI.exe on thesame location as cyko.exe

and ye you can place the whole folder containing cyko.exe and HandBrakeCLI.exe wherever you want afterwards
and you can even carry it on your USB Flash Drive if you want to encode on a different PC
